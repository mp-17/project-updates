Progress:

* Finish the background and introduction chapters.
* Rerun all the transformer simulations and also tested the matrix multiplication with different sizes.
* Debugged post-layout simulation with Matteo and identified that the X-propagation issue is likely caused by unwanted latches in the vanilla Ara design. As for the power testing, due to the slow speed of post-layout simulation (and also the power analysis), it is not feasible to test the power of the transformer. However, since matrix multiplication dominates the power, I will test the power of one iteration of matrix multiplication and use this data to estimate the power of the transformer.

Next Week:
* Proceed with the report and power testing.
