Progress:
* Optimized the MatMul execution: 1. For each lane, clear the data dependency once the dependent instruction is completed. 2. Use AXI burst mode for result storing. Here are the updated results, the 16-lane Ara achieves 95% utilization.
* Performed the backend flow on the new design and compared the results with the baseline (4 lanes config). Although the flow was interrupted at the final export stage for some reasons, some problems can still be found: 1. The lane area utilization is too high (86%, also for baseline). Maybe we should increase the lane area. 2. Critical paths between the upper left and lower right lanes ï¼ˆWNS: -240ps, 15% max frequency drop). The broadcast path connects all the lanes in series, like a ring. But the existing floorplan does not place the lanes in order, which causes this diagonal path. (schematic)

Next Week:
* Optimize the floor plan so that the broadcast path connects all the lanes optimally.
* Modify transformer kernels to accommodate the transposed matrix.
