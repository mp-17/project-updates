Progress:
* Finished all RTL designs for new instructions
* Verified the hardware with the basic RISC-V test, new MatMul with unit REUSE_SIZE (number of times the b-vector is reused)
* In my design, the broadcast data will be transferred from lane to lane. However, some lanes may not be ready to receive the new data (e.g., the FPU is not ready), and then the entire broadcast path will be stalled (otherwise the data is missed). This is very rare in the case of 4 lanes, but it can be problematic as the number of lanes increases. Currently I add a FIFO (schematic) to the path; the benefit is that if the next lane is not ready, the current lane can still receive new data (the next lane reads the old data from the FIFO). And this can also cut the in-out path (output ready depends on the input ready from the next lane).

Next Week:
* Finish the verification of the improved broadcast path.
* Run the new MatMul benchmark on the new Ara.
