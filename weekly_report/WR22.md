Progress:
Measured the power of a portion of the matrix multiplication, which represents 95% of the total power consumption of the transformer. The modified Ara uses 4mW less power than the original design(202W). The new design has a higher leakage power due to the addition of two data FIFOs, but it uses less power for the vector register file because it only accesses one operand. As the number of lanes increases, the energy efficiency gain will be more pronounced.
Wrote a methodology section in the report that describes the methods and strategies used in the project.

Next Week:
P&R Ara with 8 lanes and measure the power.
Continue with the report
