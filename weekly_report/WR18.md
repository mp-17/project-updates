Progress:
* Optimized the floorplan; the broadcast related slack is reduced from -234ps to -94ps (~10% Tck). To completely cut this path, the FIFO for buffering can be moved from the output side to the input side because most of the delay occurs in the FPU. The worst critical path (-112ps) is inside the mask unit, which is also the worst path of the baseline. (Matteo said this path can be optimized using flat mode)
* Replaced all strided memory operations in softmax and layernorm with the unit-stride operations (transposed matrix). The performance of softmax is improved 2x and layernorm is improved 3x.

Next Week:
* Complete modifications to other kernels to support transposed matrix
* Run the backend again to get better timing results.
