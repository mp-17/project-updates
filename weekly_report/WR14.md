Progress:
* Finished the RTL design for FPU control logic, vector register request logic, and broadcast length configuration logic.
* Broadcast unit: if we use a module to broadcast data to all the lanes, we will have problems with the physical design and probably get performance degradation. Therefore, I will not use such a unit but design a pipeline-like datapath: The data will be sent to the first lane and registered for one cycle, then sent to the next lane (same for the remaining lanes).

Next Week:
* Complete the data hazard tracking for new instructions and verification.
