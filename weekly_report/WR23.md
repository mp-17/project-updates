Progress:

* Continued thesis writing.
* Measured the power of the inner loops of MatMul. However, this measurement represents the worst-case power usage and is disproportionately high compared to the average power consumption for small matrix sizes. Therefore, I will use the average power instead.


Next Week:

* Test the power of 8-lane Ara. Unfortunately, I didn't use the correct commit of the backend repo, and I had to restart the backend this week. I guess I need more time for the power testing, since the 8-lane backend takes much more time than the 4-lane. 
* Complete thesis.
* Prepare for the presentation.
