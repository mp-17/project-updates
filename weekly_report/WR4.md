Progress:
* Implemented layer normalization, ReLU activation, and self-attention with rvv-intrinsic in bare-metal c.
* Learned different exponential function hardware implementation methods: 1. Taylor expansion, 2. look-up table, 3. CORDIC interpolation, 4. parabolic synthesis.

Next Week:
* Verify the implemented kernels with the Spike simulator.
* Finish the transformer C program.
