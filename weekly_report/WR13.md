Progress:
* Verified the new MatMul algorithm and instructions with customized LLVM compiler and Spike simulator
* Finished the RTL logic for decoding and the broadcast load instruction.
* Here is a short explanation of the new MatMul algorithm. If we split the matrix multiplication into several matrix-vector multiplications and focus only on mat_a Ã— vec_b, the new algorithm will load the elements in one column of mat_a into each lane equally and load vec_b from memory only once and broadcast it to each lane. (small demo)

Next Week:
* Finish RTL design for new instructions.
* Test the performance effect of strided load/store operations.
