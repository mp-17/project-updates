Progress:
* Added LLVM support for custom instructions by changing the backend of the compiler. (Custom instructions can be successfully generated in the assembly file)
* Customized Spike (ISA simulator) to simulate the new instructions. (need to fix some bugs)
* Implemented a new hardware module to support instruction vle32bc (broadcast load)
* Analyzed the reasons for the low vector instruction issue rate of cva6. cva6 needs to load the floating point operand of vfmacc.vf, and the loading time is about ten cycles long.

Next Week:
* Complete all software support for the new instructions, and use the spike simulator to verify the new MatMul algorithm.
* Continue to design the hardware for new instructions.
